              Kshitij Mathur, the Founder and Creative Director of The Luxe
              Legacy Show, is a 21-year-old visionary whose journey blends
              literature, medicine, and entrepreneurship into a unique narrative
              of passion and purpose. Born in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, Kshitij
              grew up immersed in an environment where education and
              storytelling were deeply valuedâ€”his mother, a Hindi and Sanskrit
              teacher, instilled in him the discipline of learning and the
              beauty of language. This influence led him to explore literature
              early, and by 2020, he had authored his first book, a heartfelt
              novel that delved into the meaning of friendship and connection.
